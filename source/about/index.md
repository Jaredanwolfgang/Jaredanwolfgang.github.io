Hi, I am Yicheng Xiao, an undergraduate students studying Computer Science at Southern University of Science and Technology. This blog is used to document some of my thoughts, some of my notes and some of my daily routines... To further explain my name, I usually refer myself as Jaredanjerry or Jaredanwolfgang. Jaredan is the name I use with my personal social media accounts. It comes from a very interesting misunderstanding that I did not know Jared as a proper English name before and called of my friends who name is Jared as Jerry the whole summer. My English name is Jerry and my German name I choose for myself is Wolfgang, so I combined them together and got Jaredanjerry and Jaredanwolfgang. You can call either way by using Jaredan, Jerry or Wolfgang.
